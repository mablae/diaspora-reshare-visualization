Diaspora-Reshare-Visualization
==============================
Forked from https://github.com/mablae/diaspora-reshare-visualization

A very interesting social use for data driven documents. 

This master branch is pretty much identical to the source repo except for some recent updates to javascript components. It will keep out-sync with pull requests to that repo.

The local branch https://github.com/rivendale2010/diaspora-reshare-visualization/tree/local contains commits made while setting it up at http://rsv.diapod.net  

To install simply copy the files to a directory on your PHP enabled webserver. If you are running IIS you will need to load the curl extension in IIS Manager.
